			        	<p>For many people, pornography is in a whole different category than prostitution. Men who would never think of buying time with a prostitute will watch porn all the time. Clearly, they are different enterprises, right?</p>
						<p>I’m not so sure. Here’s why…</p>

						<p>We need to be clear what we mean by “pornography.” Are we talking about the end product (the pictures and movies created), or are we talking about the industry that makes that product? If we’re talking about the industry, then pornography is most certainly prostitution. People are getting paid to perform sexual acts. The only difference is there’s a camera in the room. </p>

						<p>From a legal perspective, the law says that any pleasure derived from the act of making a porn film is not what the actors or actresses are getting paid for. They are getting paid to act. They are being paid to make a film, and for this reason, they are not considered prostitutes.</p>
						<p>But this is really a false distinction. If I went to a prostitute and I brought a camera with me and said, “Okay, I’d like to hire you to make this film with me. I’m going to have sex with you and record it so I can go back again to watch it for my personal use. Oh, by the way, I might really enjoy the whole experience, but that’s not what I’m paying you for. I’m paying you as an actress in my film.”</p>
						<blockquote class="cite">
							<p>For example, we have an element of width: 100px; within a viewport of 400px width. At this point, the element spans 1/4 of the screen. If the user zooms in to a scale of 2, the viewport width now becomes 200px, but the element remains 100 CSS pixels wide. At this point, the element spans 1/2 of the screen.
      Setting the initial-scale tells the browser what the ratio between CSS pixels and viewport pixels should be on the initial load of the page. Generally, this will be 1:1.</p>

						<p>This seems completely ridiculous. First, it overlooks the obvious: she’s engaging in an act of paid sex for the pleasure of others, which is the very motive of prostitution. Second, porn is, in some sense, even more exploitative: you are not just using the woman one time for your selfish pleasure; you are now exploiting her image again and again for pleasure.</p>
						<p>There’s so much more to the story. To learn more about the connection between porn and other forms of sexual exploitation, download the book, Stop the Demand.</p>

												<p>Nice start, Becky. I really like some of the elements you have going so far. The header and footer tie in nicely and the ribbon on tiles works well. The font is great also and looks readable. Here are a few areas you can keep iterating on:</p>

												<p>Wow, guys. Lots of great feedback.</p>
												<p>First, <a href="#">@Milkmusket</a>, I agree. I've struggled with that section and might take advice for <a href="#">@albanesetr</a> and focus on a single feature rather than the whole screenshot.</p>
												<p><a>@Hans</a>, I usually try to go for drop shadows pumped with a little color, may not be the case here but thanks for the comment. And for the header noise, and noise overall in the site, I need to try reducing it all around before we go live.</p>
												<p><a>@albanesetr</a>, thanks for all the good feedback. The pricing plans are definitely still WIP, the yellow $150 should have a "Most Popular" header, you're right. Other mockups had it, not sure why I haven't put it up yet.</p>
												<p>I'll try reducing the header, the active state was just conceptual at this point. For the one shown, I was considering a fixed header and wanted the user to see where they were at when scrolling. So the thick yellow bar would slide when you scroll.</p>
												<p>Again, thanks everyone. I really enjoy the feedback on Forrst. Much more in depth than over at Dribbble. :P</p>

												<p>So after a year and a half i have decided to redesign my portfolio, all images on these are placeholders, I also still have some ideas i have yet to add.</p>
							
												<p>Also a question for you guys, do you ever start to dislike your design after a while even though you loved it initially, because that's happening to me right now. I don't know what it is about this design, but I get annoyed when I look at it. Naturally I don't want others to feel that way when they visit my portfolio</p>

												<p>Awesome. Always like to see illustrated characters. Some quick pieces of feedback:</p>
							
												<ul class="bullets">
													<li>The body positioning looks a bit unnatural, especially for the female character. Her hips and bossom should be aligned at the angle her body is turned.</li>
													<li>The arms are a bit too long and have an unnatural bend at the elbows.</li>
													<li>The fingers don't seem to be grasping the phones. They seem to sit on the palm.</li>
